Tips for S/4HANA mostly in Financial 

Tips that can help you wit SAP S/4HANA

I have created this Word file to colect all tips that can help in my work as SAP FI consultant. I have started as a consultant in 2007 mostly in the Financial area and with its integrations (which means all SAP modules since all of them send accounting information) So the most tips are all about Financials module but it will have other moudles as well over time. All challenge that I faced or will face I will add here.

Important to notice the temporal date of my tips as technology advance in a fast pace so they can get oudated as time pass on. Be alert!!!!

And feel free to improve this document with your own tips: maybe is that tip that will make us all shine in the field or solve a problem. 

Remember: don't trust in your memory, write it down, copy the screenshots, be as much didactic as possible, yourself from the future will be eternally gratefull, so create your own manual and shine a lot :)!!!!
